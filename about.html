  <p>
    Nattakon Lertwattanaruk (b. 2006) is a composer and performer originally from Bangkok, Thailand. His works often engage with the reconstruction of cultural and musical phenomena abstracted from their original contexts, instruments as a site of physical exploration and extension, and the integration of multimedia in dialogue with the concert setting. He is a recipient of the Distinguished Prize at the SCG Young Thai Artist Award (2022, 2024) and has collaborated with ensembles including Tacet(i), the Thai Youth Orchestra, Kul-Gänte, and Duo Dubois. His work has been presented at numerous international festivals, such as the Thailand New Music and Arts Symposium, IntAct Festival, Thailand International Composition Festival, Princess Galyani Vadhana International Music Festival, and the China-ASEAN Music Festival. Nattakon is currently pursuing a Bachelor of Music in Composition at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, where he studies under Dr. Evis Sammoutis. Previous mentors include Piyawat Louilarpprasert, Daniel Pesca, and Mikel Kuehn.
